# Practical Test

The Training System for Country Delegation will control the training activities for each skill where this country will participate in a competition. For this system the access will be restricted, and all information can be registered in a database. The data will be provided in JSON format for the future development of the client-side web system that will present the information in a nice way for the final users.

There are the main objectives/functionalities for the system:
1. Register the users in one profile (board, expert, trainer or competitor) for a skill (optional): Just logged users with Board profile can realize this operation, for other profiles an error message must be returned. This are the fields for the user registration:
    -	Name, text mandatory;
    -	E-mail, text mandatory;
    -	username, text mandatory;
    -	Password, text mandatory;
    -	Profile, mandatory with one of these options (board, expert, trainer or competitor)
    -	Skill, optional;
2.	Login in the system: Just registered users can do login in the system using login and password information. For not registered users and with wrong access information, the error message return.
3.	Register and manage (insert/update/delete) a training activity for one skill: It is possible for users with expert profile maintain information about the training activities in the system. These are the fields for one activity:
    -	Skill, mandatory with one of skills registered in the skills table;
    -	Title text mandatory;
    -	Description text mandatory;
    -	Start date, date mandatory;
    -	End date, date mandatory with validation for date bigger then start date;
    -	Participants, list of participants (users) of the activity, mandatory. Validation to just include participants with the same skill in their registration data.
4.	List of activities: Return the information of activities registered based in the filter variables. This  information just can be provided for logged users in any profile;
5.	Logout: Permit a logged user do logout in the system. 
To realize these actions, you must develop these services:

You should use the JSON file “Sample_ServerSide.postman_collection.json” provided to test the API using POSTMAN Chrome Extension. Please see the description in each test for usage.
The system should handle input of data and responses should follow the above specification.


## DATABASE
Create and use a database, create at least the tables for users, profiles, skills and activities. Create a DUMP of your database and send it with the project.
